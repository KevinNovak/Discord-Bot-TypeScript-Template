# Terms of Service

## Usage Agreement

By inviting the bot or using its features, you are agreeing to the below mentioned Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

You acknowledge that you have the privilege to use the bot freely on any Discord server you share with it, that you can invite it to any server that you have "Manage Server" rights for and that this privilege might get revoked for you, if you're subject of breaking the terms and/or policy of this bot, or the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and/or Community Guidelines of Discord Inc.

Through inviting or interacting with the bot it may collect specific data as described in its [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy). The intended usage of this data is for core functionalities of the bot such as command handling, server settings, and user settings.

## Intended Age

The bot may not be used by individuals under the minimal age described in Discord's Terms of Service.

Features, such as those which are marked as "NSFW" (Not safe for work) may not be used by individuals under the age of maturity in their country. Doing so will be seen as a violation of these terms.

## Affiliation

The bot is not affiliated with, supported by, or made by Discord Inc.

Any direct connection to Discord or any of its trademark objects is purely coincidental. We do not claim to have the copyright ownership of any of Discord's assets, trademarks or other intellectual property.

## Liability

The owner(s) of the bot may not be made liable for individuals breaking these Terms at any given time. We have faith in the end users being truthful about their information and not misusing this bot or the services of Discord Inc in a malicious way.

We reserve the right to update these terms at our own discretion, giving you a 1-week (7 days) period to opt out of these terms if you're not agreeing with the new changes.

You may opt out by removing the bot from any server you have the rights for.

## Contact

People may get in contact through the official support server of the bot.

Other ways of support may be provided but aren't guaranteed.

# Privacy Policy

## Usage of Data

The bot may use stored data, as defined below, for different features including but not limited to:

-   Command handling
-   Providing server and user preferences

The bot may share non-sensitive data with 3rd party sites or services, including but not limited to:

-   Aggregate/statistical data (ex: total number of server or users)
-   Discord generated IDs needed to tie 3rd party data to Discord or user-provided data

Personally identifiable (other than IDs) or sensitive information will not be shared with 3rd party sites or services.

## Updating Data

The bot's data may be updated when using specific commands.

Updating data can require the input of an end user, and data that can be seen as sensitive, such as content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands.

## Temporarily Stored Data

The bot may keep stored data in an internal caching mechanic for a certain amount of time. After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the server.

## Removal of Data

Manual removal of the data can be requested through the official support server. Discord IDs such as user, guild, role, etc. may be stored even after the removal of other data in order to properly identify bot specific statistics since those IDs are public and non-sensitive.

For security reasons we will ask you to provide us with proof of ownership to the data you wish to be removed. Only a server owner may request manual removal of server data.
