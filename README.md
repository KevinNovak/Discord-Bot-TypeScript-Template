**Discord bot** - A TypeScript Discord bot template with multi-machine sharding and other features.

## Features

-   Written with TypeScript and [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).
-   Multi-machine sharding.
-   Basic command structure.
-   Rate limit commands.
-   Shows server count in bot presence.
-   Posts bot server counts to popular bot sites.
-   Support for running with the [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) process manger.
-   Built-in debugging setup for VSCode.

## Setup

1. Copy example config files.
    - Navigate to the `config` folder of this project.
    - Copy all files ending in `.example.json` and remove the `.example` from the copied file names.
        - Ex: `config.example.json` should be copied and renamed as `config.json`.
2. Obtain a bot token.
    - You'll need to create a new bot in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
        - See [here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/) for detailed instructions.
        - At the end you should have a **bot token**.
3. Modify the config file.
    - Open the `config/config.json` file.
    - You'll need to edit the following values:
        - `client.token` - Your discord bot token.
4. Install packages.
    - Navigate into the downloaded source files and type `npm install`.

## Start Scripts

You can run the bot in 3 different modes:

1. Non-Shard Mode
    - Type `npm start`.
    - This runs the bot directly with Node and without shards.
    - Use this mode for general development.
2. Shard Mode
    - Type `npm run start:shard`.
    - This runs the bot directly with Node and with sharding enabled.
    - Use this mode if you are testing sharding.
3. PM2 Mode
    - Run by typing `npm run start:pm2`.
    - This runs the bot using the process manager [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).
    - Use this mode if you require the bot to always be online.
